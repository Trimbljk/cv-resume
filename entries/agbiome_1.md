notes: [
  "I performed microbial isolation, stocking, and growth for pest assays;
  I led an experiment that resulted in the addition of a selective isolation strategy
  that has been used for about half of AgBiome's 80,000+ microbe collection.",
  "I identified candidate pesticidal proteins from microbial genomes using CLC Genomics Workbench,
  and developed a Python workflow to prepare the resulting data for patent filing. This protein
  collection resulted in multiple research partnership deals with other biotech companies.",
  "I led the project planning, user testing, and coordination with a software partner for
  development of a Postgres database and Ruby-on-Rails application. This was a multi-year project
  with a budget ranging up to $1M per year, and resulting in a product used across the
  company for over 7 years."
